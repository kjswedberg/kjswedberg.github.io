Today, I installed Anaconda for Windows. My goal was to see if the Anaconda for Windows would install also install python. So, I first uninstalled python. The documentation on how I installed Anaconda can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12sHhiw5txSesbleHt-_Q4KMpa-jSpMhNcIE7BVjdjco/edit?usp=sharing). Anaconda does install and allow one to use Jupyter Notebook and Spyder. However, after installing Anaconda, the command terminal would not display the version of python that was installed. So, the best method to install python from python.org. When both Anaconda are installed and python from python.ord, the both work as they should.

Today, I looked into different documentations for softwares that are used to create GUI interfaces, such as PyQT and Tkinter.

Today, I cleaned up the Event-to-Influx jupyter notebooks by removing unneeded spaces. Both versions of the Event-to-Influx work. Event-to-influx-Version2 is the most recent version and may be easier to follow. I also made sure that everything done in the files had comments associated with it.

This morning, I used the Shelly 1PM power meter on a blow dryer to get more data points. The actual current and the actual voltage were measured with a clamp-on meter that could read AC current and with a digital multimeter. [This Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1evgPBBHH2XYcFCAERA_7hmZKDgcDnaXJryOPfYvQiyg/edit?usp=sharing) shows the measured values, the actual power that was calculated from those measured values, and the power that the Shelly app said that the blow dryer. A coffee maker was also measured, while it was heating up water. The measured current and the measured voltage for the coffee maker was close enough to the measured current and the measured voltage of the blow dryer, while it was on its cool, high setting. This made the actual measured powers for those two loads close in value. However, the power that the Shelly app read for the two loads were not close in value, but were 68 W apart instead. The percent errors for the measurements that were made today are higher than 20 % and less than 35 %. The meter used to measure the current was rated to be accurate to plus/minus 2 %, while the digital multimeter was rated to be accurate to plus/minus 0.5 %. When some values were repeated, the Shelly app was not as precise as it was during the measurements that were done during Week 2. Based off of the data that was collected today, this meter is not accurate and precise enough to use for important power measurements. Figure 1 shows the power meter bar graph with the calculated power and the measured power results. In this case, the calculated power is the power that was calculated from the measured voltage and the measured current, while the measured power is the power that the Shelly 1PM power meter measured. Figure 2 shows a graph that compares the percent error between the measured power and the calculated power with the measured current.

During the afternoon, I installed Jupyter Notebooks and Anaconda on the Chromebook. I also started to think about how I would create a timeseries measurement with the Shelly 1PM power meter to use with Telegraf to create some graphs with Grafana. So far, the way that I can think of is to create a csv file with the data and see if Telegraf can read the data from that file. However, I need to find more information on how to create the data csv file, so that I can ensure that Telegraf can read the data file. I have enabled cloud on the Shelly app to see if the power used at set intervals will be stored in the app. I plugged a clock into the Shelly power meter to collect data from, so that I can see how the app will store the data.

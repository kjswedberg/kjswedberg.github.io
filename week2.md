This morning, I set up a Raspberry Pi computer. This involved putting together the box, which was designed as a 3D jigsaw puzzle. The lid of the box is the computer's screen. After attaching the mouse, keyboard, and screeen to the Rasberry Pi and turning everything on, the computer worked. However, the HDMI mini port on the Raspberry Pi and the HDMI Mini to HDMI cord plugged into the port were acting extremly finicky. After 30 seconds of messing with the cord where it entered the HDMI mini port, I was able to make the screen display the desktop. As soon as I let go of the cord, the screen turned black. I was able to confirm that the HDMI Mini to HDMI cord functioned properly by using it to connect a different computer to the screen. When I tried an HDMI Mini to HDMI (female) adaptor with a regular HDMI cord, the Raspberry Pi and the screen functioned properly together. With the screen working with the Raspberry Pi, I confirmed that the Raspberry Pi could connect to the WIFI and had speakers pre-attached to it. I also explored some of the programs that were pre-installed on the Raspberry Pi.

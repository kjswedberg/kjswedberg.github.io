This morning, I set up a Raspberry Pi computer. This involved setting up the box, which was designed as a 3D puzzle. The lid of the box is the computer's screen. After attaching the mouse, keyboard, and screeen to the Rasberry Pi and turning everything on, the computer worked. However, the HDMI mini port on the Raspberry Pi and the HDMI Mini to HDMI cord inserted into the port were acting extremly finicky. After 30 seconds of wiggling where the cord entered the HDMI mini port, I was able to make the screen display the desktop. As soon as I let go of the cord, the screen turned black. I was able to confirm that the HDMI Mini to HDMI cord functioned properly by hooking a different computer to the screen. When I tried an HDMI Mini to HDMI Female adaptor with a regular HDMI cord, the Raspberry Pi and the screen funcioned properly together. With the screen working with the Raspberry Pi, I connected the Raspberry Pi to Wifi, watched a short YouTube video to see if it had speakers, and explored some of the pre-installed apps like Libreoffice.

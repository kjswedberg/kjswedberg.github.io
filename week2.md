This morning, I set up a Raspberry Pi computer. This involved putting together the box, which was designed as a 3D jigsaw puzzle. The lid of the box is the computer's screen. After attaching the mouse, keyboard, and screeen to the Raspberry Pi and turning everything on, the computer worked. However, the HDMI mini port on the Raspberry Pi and the HDMI Mini to HDMI cord plugged into the port were acting extremly finicky. After 30 seconds of messing with the cord where it entered the HDMI mini port, I was able to make the screen display the desktop. As soon as I let go of the cord, the screen turned black. I was able to confirm that the HDMI Mini to HDMI cord functioned properly by using it to connect a different computer to the screen. When I tried an HDMI Mini to HDMI (female) adaptor with a regular HDMI cord, the Raspberry Pi and the screen functioned properly together. With the screen working with the Raspberry Pi, I confirmed that the Raspberry Pi could connect to the WIFI and had speakers pre-attached to it. I also explored some of the programs that were pre-installed on the Raspberry Pi.

During the afternoon, I worked with the Node-Red software that was on the Raspberry Pi. This software allows for the sensors to be programmed, so that the Raspberry Pi knows what pins are inputs and what it should output to where. To start learning how to do this, I found [instructions on the T3 website](https://t3alliance.org/lessons/rpi-node-red-inject-debug-hello-world/) that showed how to set some of the sensors up and what some of the sensors do. While doing this, I started inventorying the sensors that came with the Raspberry Pi kit.

This morning, I worked more with the Raspberry Pi and with the Node-Red software. I used the resources on the T3 website as a reference, and tried different combinations of the different sensors. I tried to test my understanding of the sensors by programming the LEDs and temperature sensor to output when a button was pressed. When the button was used with the temperature sensor, data was outputed when the button was pushed and when it was released. However, the goal was to only output the data when the button was pressed. I also experemented with the different time settings in the inject node settings, so that the temperature was read once per minute. 

During the afternoon, I set up a Chromebook with Linux. After installing Linux, I installed Docker on the Chromebook by using the command terminal. After confirming that Docker was installed properly, I went through some [documentation on Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

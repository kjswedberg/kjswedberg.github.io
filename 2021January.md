Today, I tried to find a way to upload the comtrade data using the pyComtrade module.

Today, I looked at the Jupyter Notebook scripts that Matt was working on for finding a way to load the comtrade data. I then experemented more with trying to load the data.

I also made a copy of the Jupyter Notebook script and used that copy to start looking into the file_HRNov-Data csv files.

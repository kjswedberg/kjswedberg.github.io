# Week 1
This week is an orientation week.

Today, I set up a GitHub account and I went through the GitHub Guides. While going through the guides, I set up this website to use as a blog. The purpose for this blog is so that I can log my summer activities that are related to my internship at ACEP.

I also verified that I could access Discord on my laptop, use the Discord voice channels, and log in to VMware Horizon HTML Access at [https://vdi.alaska.edu/](https://vdi.alaska.edu/).

This morning, I learned basic [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Yesterday, I had become familiar with the basic Markdown that is discussed in the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Today, I became familier with the information about basic Markdown that is discussed [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and I am reviewing the information that I had learned about Markdown yesterday. 

* Things to learn in basic Markdown:
  * [x] Headers / Subheaders 
  * [x] Lists 
  * [x] Web links 
  * [x] check lists 
  * [x] Quick access to single code lines 
  * [x] multi-lines code lines with language highlighting 

I started to become familar with Research Workspace by first setting up a Research Workspace account. Afterwhich, I went though some Research Workspace documentation located [here](https://researchworkspace.com/help/Overview.html) on Research Workspace and [here](https://www.axiomdatascience.com/best-practices/DataManagementBestPractices.html#organizing-folders-within-a-project) on Axiom Data Science. 

I was introduced to the Thermal Decay Test Collection Kit over Zoom during the afternoon. The introduction included information regarding the collectors, a centralizer, end nodes (433 mHz temperature and humidity sensors), and a RPI real time clock. The hardware goals for the project include modeling the designed system to create a plan of attack and to document everything. Technical documentation goals include determing how much power it uses, how long it will last using its back-up batteries, and instrucions on assembling and deploying the system.

I also read though [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/this-will-make-you-a-command-line-ninja-93a51cdb16b1), which was posted to Discord. The article is about using command lines. I had done very simple tasks using the command line terminal during high school on Windows 8, however a lot of the information in the article was new to me. So I found an tutorial about the Linux command line for begineers that I am planning on going through sometime. That tutural is located [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview).

This morning, I started out by going through the ERDC Purchase Request Document and marking down the information that I could find for power usage. I was not able to find the power usage for all of the items. I was able to find how much power was supplied by any power supplies, the approximate output power supplied by the 6 V solar panel, the rated power range for the 3 pin Female DC Power Jack Panel, and approximate power used by the Strip of 150 Neopixels. For the 22AWG solid core hook-up wire, I was able to find a current rating of 3.0 A. 

During the afternoon, I was assigned a daily quest to summarize the differences between backups and archives and the differences between realtime, near-realtime, and batch. The main difference between backup and archives is that backups are copies of data to be used if something happens to the original data and archives are inactive data that is being kept for future reference. Realtime is where the data is inputted and the processed data is outputted near-instantaneously later. Near-realtime is where the data is inputted and processed data is outputted at a slower rate than realtime. Batch is where the data is inputted and stored so that all of the data can be processed and outputted together at a much later time. The resources that I used for this quest are listed below. <br>

Today, I set up a GitHub account and I went through the GitHub Guides. While going through the guides, I set up this website to use as a blog. The purpose for this blog is so that I can log my summer activities that are related to my internship at ACEP.

This morning, I am learning basic [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).  Yesterday, I had become familiar with the basic Markdown that is discussed in the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Today, I am becoming familier with the information about basic Markdown that is discussed [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and I am reviewing the information that I had learned about Markdown yesterday. 

* Things to learn in basic Markdown:
  * [x] Headers / Subheaders 
  * [x] Lists 
  * [x] Web links 
  * [x] check lists 
  * [x] Quick access to single code lines 
  * [x] multi-lines code lines with language highlighting 

After learning about Markdown, I started reading though [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/this-will-make-you-a-command-line-ninja-93a51cdb16b1), so that I could become more familar with command lines. I also set up a Research Workspace account.

This week is an orientation week.

Today, I set up a GitHub account and I went through the GitHub Guides. While going through the guides, I set up this website to use as a blog. The purpose for this blog is so that I can log my summer activities that are related to my internship at ACEP.

This morning, I am learning basic [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).  Yesterday, I had become familiar with the basic Markdown that is discussed in the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Today, I am becoming familier with the information about basic Markdown that is discussed [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and I am reviewing the information that I had learned about Markdown yesterday. 

* Things to learn in basic Markdown:
  * [x] Headers / Subheaders 
  * [x] Lists 
  * [x] Web links 
  * [x] check lists 
  * [x] Quick access to single code lines 
  * [x] multi-lines code lines with language highlighting 

I started to become familar with Research Workspace by first setting up a Research Workspace account. Afterwhich, I went though some Research Workspace documentation located at https://researchworkspace.com/help/Overview.html and at https://www.axiomdatascience.com/best-practices/DataManagementBestPractices.html#organizing-folders-within-a-project. 

I also read though [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/this-will-make-you-a-command-line-ninja-93a51cdb16b1), which was posted to Discord and is about using command lines. I had done very simple tasks using the command line terminal during high school on Windows 8, however a lot of the stuff discussed in the article was new. So I found an tutorial about the Linux command line for begineers that I am planning on going through sometime. That tutural is located [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview).

Today, I set up a GitHub account and I went through the GitHub Guides. While going through the guides, I set up this website 
to use as a blog. The purpose for this blog is so that I can log my summer activities that are related to my internship
at ACEP. :technologist:

This morning, I am learning basic [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Things that I became familar with between 
yesterday and today are creating headings, lists, and adding web links. Yesterday, I became familiar with the basic Markdown that is 
discussed in the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Today, I became familier with the information 
about basic Markdown that is discussed [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

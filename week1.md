# Week 1
This week is an orientation week. 

### Monday, May 18, 2020
Today, I set up a GitHub account and I went through the GitHub Guides. While going through the guides, I set up this website 
to use as a blog. The purpose for this blog is so that I can log my summer activities that are related to my internship
at ACEP.

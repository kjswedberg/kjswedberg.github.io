Today I started working with the 2021-02-collection.corrected meter event files. I started uploading some of the corrected files to the research workspace and I omited the original cfg files during the upload. The original cfg files seemed to create an issue with the Comtrade module trying to upload two cfg files, the original and the corrected version. However, the Comtrade module only works with the corrected version being uploaded.

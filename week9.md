# Week 9

## Monday, July 13, 2020

This morning, with Arsh's help, I got the Vodafone Mobile Broadand USB Stick working. 

I also set up the Raspberry Pi with the 7 inch touchscreen display. For the next two days, the Shelly 1PM meter will be measuring the power that is being used by the Raspberry Pi, silver RTL-SDR, and the 7 inch display. The data from the Shelly 1PM meter is being sent to the TIG-Playground. On the TIG-Playground, a seperate dashboard was set up for the 7 inch display. The dashboard for the 13.3 display was saved, so that the default time range was the time range that correspondes to the 13.3 inch display. The two dashboards were then set up as a Playlist, so that they could be compared easier.

This afternoon, I worked on the presentation for Friday and more on a DataCamp course about Pandas.

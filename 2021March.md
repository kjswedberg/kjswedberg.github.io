## March 8, 2021 - March 12, 2021
During the week from March 8 to March 12, I worked on viewing the meter event datasets. The notes that I created when doing this can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RnZ9US1l3epAWHpyJMxsfYGUi1PKdDjBQN7YQ2ObzHU/edit?usp=sharing).

I tried looking for the 7:00 event file for an "it came back on" event that was related to a "going off" event. However, the last event that I found was the "going off" event. Of the data that was collected on March 5 that is on the shared drive, there is no folder for the meter with that event.

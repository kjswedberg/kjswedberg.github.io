# Week 6

## Monday, June 22, 2020
This morning, I re-started Telegraf on the Raspberry Pi. Due to a power outage yesterday, Telegraf had stopped sending data from the Shelly meter and the temperature/humidity sensors to InfluxDB. re-starting Telegraf today involved updating the config files and Grafana to the new IP address, publishing the data from the sensors to a MQTT server, and starting Telegraf with the two config files.

I also started working on creating slides for a presentation about the Shelly 1PM meter.

During the afternoon, I started the Intermediate Python course with DataCamp. I also attending a meeting at the Solar Site.

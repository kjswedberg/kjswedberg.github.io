# Week 7

## Monday, June 29, 2020

Today, I work more on learning about WireViz. I tried out the options for the wire gauge and the connector type on the wiring diagram for the Shelly 1PM meter. The connector type seems to be treated as a string. Whatever is inserted for it is then put on the diagram and the bill of materials. This would allow for custom connectors to be inserted for the type. After this, I worked on figuring out how to do a demo of this. I think that the easiest way is to show the yml file, the command to run WireViz, the files generated, and the resulting diagram and bill of materials.

I also started DataCamp's Data Prcessing in Shell course.

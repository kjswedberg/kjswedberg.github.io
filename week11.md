# Week 11

## Monday, July 27, 2020

Today, I edited the final report.

I also worked more on the Jupyter Notebook script in the RCRE RW. I figured out how to take the variable that is associated with time1 and convert that into a Pandas DataFrame. I am going to try to do this for the rest of the time coordinates and then merge the 37 DataFrames into one DataFrame with a common Timestamp column as the index. Rob Cermak found a way to make a dictionary that contains the variables that are associated with each time coordinates. Rather than making the lists of variables manually, like I did with time1, I might try to do something similar.

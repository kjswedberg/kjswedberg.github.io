# Week 10

## Monday, July 20, 2020

This morning, I worked on a Jupyter Notebook that inputs a NetCDF (.nc) file from the Remote Community Renewable Energy Research Workspace project. So far, the Jupyter Notebook can open and read the file as a dataset by using the open_dataset function in the xarray library. When the to_dataframe() function is used to convert this dataset to a dataframe, the error `ValueError: iterator is too large` occurs. Other people who have had this problem have at least one dimension that is unlimited. 

During the Afternoon, I worked on the slides for the Vodcast. I am planning on using the OpenShot software to make the Vodcast. Today, I installed the software and started working on making slides.

# Week 1
This week is an orientation week. 

## Monday, May 18, 2020
Today, I set up a GitHub account and I went through the GitHub Guides. While going through the guides, I set up this website to use as a blog. The purpose for this blog is so that I can log my summer activities that are related to my internship at ACEP.

I also verified that I could access Discord on my laptop, use the Discord voice channels, and log in to VMware Horizon HTML Access at [https://vdi.alaska.edu/](https://vdi.alaska.edu/).

This morning, I learned basic [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Yesterday, I had become familiar with the basic Markdown that is discussed in the [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Today, I became familier with the information about basic Markdown that is discussed [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and I am reviewing the information that I had learned about Markdown yesterday. 

* Things learned in basic Markdown:
  * [x] Headers / Subheaders 
  * [x] Lists 
  * [x] Web links 
  * [x] check lists 
  * [x] Quick access to single code lines 
  * [x] multi-lines code lines with language highlighting 

I started to become familar with Research Workspace by first setting up a Research Workspace account. Afterwhich, I went though some Research Workspace documentation located [here](https://researchworkspace.com/help/Overview.html) on Research Workspace and [here](https://www.axiomdatascience.com/best-practices/DataManagementBestPractices.html#organizing-folders-within-a-project) on Axiom Data Science. 

I was introduced to the Thermal Decay Test Collection Kit over Zoom during the afternoon. The introduction included information regarding the collectors, a centralizer, end nodes (433 mHz temperature and humidity sensors), and a RPI real time clock. The hardware goals for the project include modeling the designed system to create a plan of attack and to document everything. Technical documentation goals include determing how much power it uses, how long it will last using its back-up batteries, and instrucions on assembling and deploying the system.

I also read though [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/this-will-make-you-a-command-line-ninja-93a51cdb16b1), which was posted to Discord. The article is about using command lines. I had done very simple tasks using the command line terminal during high school on Windows 8, however a lot of the information in the article was new to me. So I found an tutorial about the Linux command line for begineers that I am planning on going through sometime. That tutorial is located [here](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview).

This morning, I started out by going through the ERDC Purchase Request Document and marking down the information that I could find for power usage. I was not able to find the power usage for all of the items. I was able to find how much power was supplied by any power supplies, the approximate output power supplied by the 6 V solar panel, the rated power range for the 3 pin Female DC Power Jack Panel, and approximate power used by the Strip of 150 Neopixels. For the 22AWG solid core hook-up wire, I was able to find a current rating of 3.0 A, assuming that it uses a rubber/vinyl conductor. 

During the afternoon, I was assigned a daily quest to make two slides about backups vs. archives and about 
realtime vs. near-realtime vs. batch. I also read the the tutorial that I found yesturday about Linux command lines, since there is a possibility that I may be using them.

This morning, I reviewed some of the power usage information that I found yesturday for the ERDC Purchase Request Document. Using that information, I made a parts list of the parts that I would need to measure the power that the Raspberry Pi's would use. This way, I could start thinking about how I would measure the total power used by the system that was built for the project. If the power used by each Raspberry Pi was measured later this summer, having this list and an idea of how to measure the power would be helpful.  

During the afternoon, I attending an ACEP meeting over Zoom. After the meeting, I started working through a tutorial about Python that is located [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). The main thing that I focused on was syntax. This was because the syntax was the main difference between Python and other programming languages that I have used in the past. The other main difference that I noticed is that some built-in function have different names in Python than they do in C++ and Matlab.

Today, I continued to learn about Python. I continued to work through the tutorial that I found yesterday. I also reviewed what I had learned about Python yesterday by using the Python resource that is located [here](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/).

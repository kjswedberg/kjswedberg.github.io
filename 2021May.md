I continued working on going through the collected meter event files and determining the number of transient event that was measured by the meters. Most of the datasets contained in the collection from March are also contained in the collection from February. Some of the meters collected over 4000 datasets. However, most of those datasets are repeats. As part of going through the datasets, I sent them to the TIG-Playground.

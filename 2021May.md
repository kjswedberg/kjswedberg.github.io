I continued working on going through the collected meter event files and determining the number of transient event that was measured by the meters. Most of the datasets contained in the collection from March are also contained in the collection from February. Some of the meters collected over 4000 datasets. However, most of those datasets are repeats. As part of going through the datasets, I sent them to the TIG-Playground.

I worked on creating a dataset with the dataset id, starting and ending timestamps, and the sensor address. I then sent those datasets to the TIG-Playground and made panels to display that information as a table. This way, someone can determine what times something is happining on the dataset plots that were created last week.
